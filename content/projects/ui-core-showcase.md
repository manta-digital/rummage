# UI Core Showcase

The **UI Core Showcase** demonstrates the power and flexibility of our framework-agnostic component library, featuring comprehensive theming, responsive design, and extensive component variations.

## Component Architecture

Built with **framework-agnostic principles** for maximum reusability:

- **Design System Foundation**: Consistent design tokens and spacing
- **Theme-Aware Components**: Dynamic color schemes with CSS custom properties
- **Responsive by Default**: Mobile-first responsive design patterns
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 compliant components with proper ARIA labels
- **TypeScript Native**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support

## Showcase Features

The showcase demonstrates:

- **Component Gallery**: Interactive examples of all available components
- **Theme Switching**: Live theme switching to demonstrate theming capabilities
- **Code Examples**: Copy-paste ready code snippets for each component
- **Design Tokens**: Visual representation of colors, typography, and spacing
- **Usage Patterns**: Common component composition patterns

## Development Benefits

- **Storybook Integration**: Comprehensive documentation and component playground
- **Hot Reload**: Instant feedback during component development
- **Visual Testing**: Automated visual regression testing
- **Cross-Framework Compatibility**: Components work in Next.js, React, Vue, and more

Perfect for teams looking to understand and implement a cohesive design system across multiple projects and frameworks.
