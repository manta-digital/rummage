# Framework Consistency Testimonial

This testimonial emphasizes the **framework parity** that manta-templates achieves - a key differentiator in the template ecosystem.

## Framework Agnostic Benefits

The quote highlights several crucial advantages:

- **Evaluation Process**: Demonstrates due diligence in template selection
- **Consistency**: Remarkable consistency between different framework implementations
- **Team Productivity**: Seamless context switching between frameworks
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Teams don't need to learn different patterns per framework

## Technical Achievement

Achieving true framework parity requires:

1. **Shared Component Libraries**: Common UI components across frameworks
2. **Unified Design Systems**: Consistent visual and interaction patterns
3. **Common Development Patterns**: Similar code organization and conventions
4. **Cross-Framework Testing**: Ensuring feature parity through comprehensive testing

This level of consistency is particularly valuable for teams working on multiple projects or migrating between frameworks.
