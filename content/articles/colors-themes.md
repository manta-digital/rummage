# Colors and Themes Research

Exploring Radix color scales with semantic token aliasing and dynamic palette switching for modern web applications.

## Color System Architecture

Our approach combines Radix's scientifically-designed color scales with semantic tokens that automatically adapt to different themes and contexts.

## Key Benefits

- **Consistent contrast ratios** across all color combinations
- **Automatic dark/light mode** support without manual overrides  
- **Accessible by default** with WCAG AA compliance built-in
- **Theme switching** without layout shift or flash

## Implementation Details

The system uses CSS custom properties with semantic naming conventions that map to Radix's numbered scales, enabling dynamic theme switching while maintaining design system consistency.
