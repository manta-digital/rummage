# Framework Agnostic Showcase

This video demonstrates the **framework parity** achieved by manta-templates, showing identical applications running on different framework foundations with consistent behavior and appearance.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

The showcase features:

- **Identical UI Components**: Same visual appearance across Next.js and React
- **Consistent Interactions**: Button clicks, form handling, and navigation
- **Shared Theming**: Theme switching works identically in both frameworks
- **Performance Comparison**: Loading times and runtime performance metrics
- **Developer Experience**: Code structure and development workflow similarities

## Framework Implementations

Demonstrates how the same application works across:

### Next.js Template
- **Server-Side Rendering**: SEO benefits and initial page load optimization
- **App Router**: Modern routing with layouts and loading states
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component integration
- **Performance**: Automatic code splitting and prefetching

### React Template (Vite)
- **Client-Side Rendering**: Fast development with instant hot reload
- **Vite Tooling**: Lightning-fast build times and development server
- **SPA Experience**: Smooth client-side navigation
- **Build Optimization**: Rollup-based production builds

## Shared Architecture Benefits

Key advantages shown:

1. **Component Reusability**: Same components work in both frameworks
2. **Design Consistency**: Identical visual design and interactions
3. **Code Sharing**: Business logic and utilities are framework-agnostic
4. **Team Flexibility**: Developers can work across different framework projects
5. **Migration Path**: Easy migration between frameworks when needed

The video proves that framework choice doesn't have to compromise design consistency or component reusability.
