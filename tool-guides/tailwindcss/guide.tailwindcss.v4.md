## Tailwind CSS v4 Guide: Key Changes, Migration, and Setup

Tailwind CSS v4 introduces major changes that break compatibility with v3, but also greatly simplify and modernize the framework. Here’s a concise guide to help you get started and avoid the pitfalls that are likely causing your project issues.

---

**Major Changes in Tailwind CSS v4**

- **CSS-First Configuration**: No more `tailwind.config.js`. All configuration is now done directly in your CSS file using the new `@theme` directive. This means you define design tokens, custom colors, breakpoints, etc., right inside your CSS[1][4][5].
- **Performance**: Build times are dramatically faster-full builds up to 5x faster, incremental builds over 100x faster[1].
- **Modern CSS Features**: Uses cascade layers, registered custom properties, logical properties, and the `color-mix()` function for more powerful and flexible styling[1].
- **Automatic Content Detection**: Tailwind now automatically finds your template files, so you don’t need to manually specify content paths[1].
- **New Utilities & Variants**: Includes new utilities like 3D transforms, expanded gradients, `not-*` variants, `field-sizing`, `color-scheme`, and more[1][3].
- **Browser Support**: v4 targets modern browsers only (Safari 16.4+, Chrome 111+, Firefox 128+). If you need to support older browsers, stick to v3.4[4].

**Migrating from Tailwind v3 to v4**

1. **Update Node.js**: You need Node.js 20 or later[2][4].
2. **Use the Official Upgrade Tool**:
   ```bash
   npx @tailwindcss/upgrade
   ```
   - This tool updates dependencies, migrates your config from JS to CSS, and adapts your template files[2][4].
   - Run it in a new Git branch to easily review and test changes[2][4].

3. **Review and Test**: After running the tool, check your project in a browser and tweak as needed. Some manual adjustments may be necessary for complex setups[2][4].

**Setting Up a New Tailwind CSS v4 Project**

1. **Install Tailwind CSS v4**:
   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss@latest @tailwindcss/cli@latest
   ```
   Or with Vite:
   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss@latest @tailwindcss/vite@latest
   ```

2. **Create Your CSS File** (e.g., `styles.css`):
   ```css
   @import "tailwindcss";

   @theme {
     --color-primary: hsl(220, 90%, 56%);
     --font-display: "Inter", sans-serif;
     --breakpoint-xl: 1280px;
     /* Add more tokens as needed */
   }
   ```

   - All your design tokens (colors, fonts, breakpoints, etc.) go inside the `@theme` block[1][5].
   - Tailwind will auto-generate utility classes for these tokens (e.g., `bg-primary`, `text-primary`)[5].

3. **Remove Old JS Config**: Delete any `tailwind.config.js` files. All configuration now lives in your CSS[1][5].

4. **Build Your CSS**: Use the CLI or your build tool as before, but now with the simplified setup.

**Common Gotchas**

- **No More `tailwind.config.js`**: Trying to use JS config will break your setup. Move all config to CSS.
- **Token Naming**: Use the right prefixes (`--color-*`, `--font-*`, etc.) for Tailwind to generate the correct utilities[5].
- **Browser Support**: If your users need older browsers, v4 may not be for you yet[4].
- **Plugins**: Some third-party plugins may not be v4-ready; check compatibility.

---

**Extra Tips**

- **New Features**: Explore new utilities like `text-shadow-*`, `mask-*`, and advanced variants for more control[3].
- **Performance**: Enjoy much faster builds, especially for incremental changes[1].

## Example: Minimal Tailwind v4 CSS Config

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@theme {
  --color-primary: #2563eb;
  --color-secondary: #64748b;
  --font-display: "Inter", sans-serif;
  --breakpoint-lg: 1024px;
}
```
This will generate classes like `bg-primary`, `text-secondary`, `font-display`, and responsive utilities for your custom breakpoints[5].

If your AI is still writing v3 code, prompt it to use the new CSS-based config and point it to the v4 documentation. This should resolve most breaking issues and save you hours of frustration.
