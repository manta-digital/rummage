We will use this as a guide for creating a project spec.  We generally will not need all of these items in each spec.  The resulting spec document constitutes the output of Phase 2 in `guide.ai-project.00-process`.  Project manager will provide guidance on any variations or changes to the standard guide in the context of a particular project.  This guide should be available to you any time you are working with a project specification.  If it is missing and you cannot find it, do not make any assumptions.  Get the document from the Project Manager before proceeding.
